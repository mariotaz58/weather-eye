On the basis of intelligent home energy conservation system, we are making this project on Temperature and humidity control and monitoring using wireless network (Wi-Fi). The latest technology being used here is Android operating system and micro-controller based sensor system, so that the monitoring and control can be done using our smart phone or a tablet pc.

This project is intended to be used as automation and hazard management ranging from domestic climate control system to small scale industrial plants.
